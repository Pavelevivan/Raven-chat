# Decentralized chat
## Description
Simple (but not pretty) chat will help you to communicate with people. Chat supports sending files(<=64 Mb, if you want to send larger files change MESSAGE_SIZE to size you want), changing nicknames messages and sharing contacts.
 It's basically group chat. Chat is based on socket interface.

Chat works only in **local network**, if someone wants to connect to you he will without your permission.
